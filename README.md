## Using queries

When using the *Read* function, you can add an array of queries to filter your results.

![queries documents](https://github.com/melohagan/budibase-datasource-appwrite-databases/assets/101575380/28a7e38f-fed6-4c7a-b299-f66cf9c1eaec)

This will work when listing documents, collections, and databases.

You must use square brackets to indicate the array, and double quotes for each query. As shown you can also use single quotes when the queries themselves have string values.
